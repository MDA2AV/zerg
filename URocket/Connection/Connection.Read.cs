/// A pooled, unsafe connection object used by a reactor-style networking engine.

/// Concurrency model:
/// - Reactor thread produces inbound buffers by calling <see cref="EnqueueRingItem"/> and <see cref="MarkClosed"/>.
/// - A single handler/consumer awaits inbound data via <see cref="ReadAsync"/> and drains using
///   <see cref="TryGetRing"/> / <see cref="TryPeekRing"/> bounded by a tail snapshot.
/// - The connection can be reused (pooled). <see cref="_generation"/> guards ValueTask tokens against reuse.
///
/// Key invariants:
/// - Only ONE outstanding ReadAsync waiter is allowed per connection (enforced by <see cref="_armed"/>).
/// - The recv ring is MPSC; consumer drains in batches defined by a tail snapshot.
/// - A close transitions <see cref="_closed"/> from 0 to 1 (published), waking any waiter.
