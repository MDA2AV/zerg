/// Connection-owned outbound write staging buffer + flush completion primitive.
///
/// Design / ownership model:
/// - The connection owns an unmanaged fixed-size slab (<see cref="WriteBuffer"/>) used for staging outgoing bytes.
/// - A *single producer* (typically the request handler / user code) appends data by advancing <see cref="WriteTail"/>.
/// - A *single consumer* (the reactor thread) flushes the staged bytes to the transport and completes the flush waiter.
///
/// Threading / correctness rules:
/// - Writes are allowed only when no flush is active (<see cref="_flushInProgress"/> == 0).
/// - <see cref="FlushAsync"/> arms a single waiter and publishes a snapshot target (<see cref="WriteInFlight"/>).
/// - The reactor must eventually call <see cref="CompleteFlush"/> exactly once per armed flush.
///
/// Invariants:
/// - Valid staged data range is [<see cref="WriteHead"/>, <see cref="WriteTail"/>).
/// - Flush target is a snapshot of tail captured in <see cref="FlushAsync"/> and stored in <see cref="WriteInFlight"/>.
/// - While flushing, producer must not modify any bytes below <see cref="WriteInFlight"/>.
